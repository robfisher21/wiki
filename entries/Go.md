Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google[11] by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.[12] Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing,[6] and CSP-style concurrency.[13] The language is often referred to as Golang because of its domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go.[14]
