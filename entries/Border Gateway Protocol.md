Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet.[1] BGP is classified as a path-vector routing protocol,[2] and it makes routing decisions based on paths, network policies, or rule-sets configured by a network administrator.
